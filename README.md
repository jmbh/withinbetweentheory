# Reproducibility Archive

Reproducibility archive for paper "Integrating Within-Person and Between-Person Phenomena in Psychological Theories"

The archive includes the following files:

- `aux_functions.R`: includes functions to estimate VAR models and to process the simulation code
- `CodeFigure3.R`: processes simulation outputs and plots Figure 3 in the paper
- The code for the simulation using the panic model by Robinaugh and colleagues was taken from a larger simulation from a different project. The code for this simulation can be found here: https://github.com/ryanoisin/ComputationalTreatment/tree/main/Simulation
- `Files/BaselineData.RDS` is the relevant data from this larger simulation which is used in `CodeFigure3.R` to create Figure 3
